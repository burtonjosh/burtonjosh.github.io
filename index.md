I'm a PhD student at the University of Manchester, researching methods for doing parameter
inference on stochastic, non-linear models of gene regulation, using time series data of gene expression dynamics.
This research uses mathematical approaches to help us understand how cells make decisions regarding fate, especially in the context of development and cancer. You can read more about my work [here](/work).

I'm currently visiting [Dr. Arno Solin's](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/group/) group in Aalto University, Finland, where I'm learning about state of the art methods for parameter inference in stochastic differential equation systems.
