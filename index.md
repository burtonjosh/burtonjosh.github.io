I'm a PhD student at the University of Manchester researching methods for doing parameter
inference on delayed stochastic non-linear models of gene regulation, using time series data of gene expression dynamics at single cell resolution. This research uses mathematical approaches to help us understand how cells make decisions regarding fate, especially in the context of development and cancer.

I've also contributed to the work done by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) in response to COVID-19. You can read more about my work [here](/work).

From March to May 2022 I visited [Dr. Arno Solin's](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/group/) group in Aalto University, Finland, where I learnt about state of the art methods for parameter inference in stochastic differential equation systems.
