@def title = "Joshua Burton"

I am currently a team member at [PlantingSpace](https://planting.space/), where I apply a mixture of Bayesian statistics, Category theory 
and Julia software development to help create a transparent, uncertainty aware general knowledge system.

I'm always interested in discovering new ways I can apply mathematics, statistics and software development skills. Take a look at my [CV](/joshua_burton_cv.pdf) or get in touch with me if you'd like to chat!

I graduated from the University of Manchester in 2023 with a PhD in Mathematical Biology. My research focussed on developing methods for doing parameter inference on delayed stochastic non-linear models of gene regulation, using time series data of gene expression dynamics at single cell resolution. My research uses mathematical approaches to help us understand how cells make decisions regarding fate, especially in the context of development and cancer.

I've also contributed to the work done by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) in response to COVID-19. You can read more about my work [here](/work).

From March to May 2022 I visited [Dr. Arno Solin's](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/group/) group in Aalto University, Finland, where I learnt about state of the art methods for parameter inference in stochastic differential equation systems.
